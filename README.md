# Interactive Visualization

Interactive visualization is becoming a more prominent feature of reporting. Business analytics packages tend to stress the ease with which data can be played with by non-experts. Within the RStudio universe this functionality is accomplished through the Shiny ecosystem - a web-app designing interface that allows web-apps to be built from within R with limited knowledge of javascript or html.

## Goals for this Project 

The goal for this project was to build and deploy and interactive R Shiny web applicationt to convey insights about data.
