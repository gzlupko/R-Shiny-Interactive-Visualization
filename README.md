# Interactive Visualization

Interactive visualization is becoming a more prominent feature of reporting. Business analytics packages tend to stress the ease with which data can be played with by non-experts. Within the RStudio universe this functionality is accomplished through the Shiny ecosystem - a web-app designing interface that allows web-apps to be built from within R with limited knowledge of javascript or html.

## Goals for this Project 

The goal for this project is to build and deploy and interactive R Shiny web applicationt to convey insights about data. 

## Tasks for this unit

If you find any other useful materials please add them under Additional Materials at the end of the this page and pull request the change back to this repo.
